Installation:

You must have python installed

1) `git clone https://github.com/Timokrut/rust-guess-pwd.git`
2) `cd rust-guess-pwd`
3) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4) `python main.py` 

Then use `alt+1` (default) to write one password

You can also customize from where to start and pick your combination (only from code rn) 

Dont forget to kill application after you guessed password (or realized it was horrible idea), just press Ctrl+C in terminal, where you started `main.py`
